# Task 
AIM: To create a neural network model of the highest accuracy, with the least number of parameters
(can read about parameters - https://towardsdatascience.com/model-parameters-and-hyperparameters-in-machine-learning-what-is-the-difference-702d30970f6 )
1. Download the dataset - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AlztDRzHhuavHPb77o9ZDHGIp6za77AR?usp=sharing
2. Created all the pre-processing steps similar to the one from the above notebooks
3. Created a Neural network model using Keras and train the model on the training
dataset
4. Tested the model on the test dataset
